# customer-loan-acceptance-predictive-analytics-using-SVM
Building a SVM to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan or not.
Universal Bank is a relatively young bank growing rapidly in terms of overall customer
acquisition. Most of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of
relationship with the bank. The customer base of asset customers (borrowers) is quite small, and
the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business. It wants to
explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers while retaining them
as depositors.
A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of
over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise smarter
campaigns with better target marketing.
The Universal Bank dataset used for this project include customer demographic information
(age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.),
and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan).
